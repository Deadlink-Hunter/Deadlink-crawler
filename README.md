# Deadlink-crawler

This is the part of Deadlink Hunter that will be in charge of scanning repos in Github, check their links into the server that checks if the link is broken or not. 

This will be a server that will be able to scan : 

Trending repos 
Trending people 
Repos with links in the README 


After we will have this we will be able to move to the next step: 

Getting all of the links from the repos
Using a service that checks the link if its broken or not (There is another repo under the organization that can tell if the link is broken or not in a very basic way)
